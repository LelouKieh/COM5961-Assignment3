# COM5961 Assignment3
 A page to submit Assignment3
<br>
<br>
Step 1:
Source of the original web pages: 
http://impressionistarts.com/most-expensive-impressionist-paintings.html

Step 2:
Since the page is poorly designed and it is quite difficult to scrap all the data at one time, I had to scrap the data twice and clean them up separately. Then I combined the two cleaned set and cleaned all data together. That is why I upload three project files. You can trace the steps following this order: Part1-Part2-all.

Step 3&4: 
The cleaned data have been imported into my Airtable with the tableâ€™s name: Sale Price.
Here is the link: https://airtable.com/invite/l?inviteId=invQcXjJgTq3Ga1kH&inviteToken=ecfbbc564c21c5b51c9632512899947875d267d07f448162655b1aae04baca5f

A page contained the link was also created, with the name "Assignment3.html".
